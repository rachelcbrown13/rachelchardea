        <p>
            In 2011 I found myself in a life-consuming relationship.  The guy was emotionally, spiritually and verbally abusive.  I soon started to conform myself to make sure he was happy due to the concerns he would often express.  Truthfully, I lost my identity in it all.  I hit a breaking point, and the Lord was there to meet me.  I remember thinking to myself, ‚Äúthe things this guy was saying about me is true, I even believe them about myself.‚Äù Then I heard the Lord say ‚ÄúAre you not man? Does man trump what I say about you?‚Äù And my life was changed in that moment! 
The real problem wasn‚Äôt that I was consumed in this relationship or that every decision I made was wrapped up in every word this guy was saying; it was the fact that I believed all the lies about myself.  I wasn‚Äôt believing the truth about myself.
Psalm 139:17-18 says: 
How precious are your thoughts about me, O God.
    They cannot be numbered!
18 I can‚Äôt even count them;
    they outnumber the grains of sand!
And when I wake up,
    you are still with me!
Instead of believing the fabrications or dishonesties being fed to me and spoken over me, I should have taken hold of the vast number of GOOD thoughts that were being spoken into me by my Creator and Father.  Motherhood, wife life, relationships, comparison, expectations and social media all fight for possession of your identity.  We give our authority to these things and ultimately find ourselves walking in lack. Lack of joy, peace, love, trust and so much more, because we have given in to lies.  My heart is to encourage other women to grab a handful of sand and imagine grain by grain how many good thoughts the Lord has about them instead of the lies and deceit we can fall victim to believing.
